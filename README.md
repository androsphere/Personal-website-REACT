# My about me website

My app is effectively a template for an about me website. I have used it to render a home page, an about page, and a page of projects which loads in objects to render from my db.json file.

The routes component sets up the client side routing and the NavBar renders the NavLink components at the top of each page.

The pieces page handles the fetch requests and rendering of pieces as well as links to my performances of those pieces. It also has a form with two inputs that allow the user to suggest pieces. These are rendered under the established pieces and posted to the database.
